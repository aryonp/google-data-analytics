00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.580
Hi there. I'm so glad you're

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.385
joining me for this last
part of the program.

3
00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:09.610
This is an end-of-
certificate project that

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.800
Coursera and other
learning platforms

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.110
usually call a capstone.

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.665
The capstone brings everything
you've learned together.

7
00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.710
You'll have the
opportunity to take all of

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.750
your new knowledge
and put it into

9
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.585
practice with a data
analytics case study.

10
00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:28.660
In this video, we'll talk
more about what that

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.550
entails and how it can help

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.890
you stand out during
a job search.

13
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.265
Case studies are practice
data analytics projects.

14
00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:38.785
When you're job hunting,

15
00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:41.350
you might be asked to
do a case study after

16
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.555
the pre-screen call or
the first interview.

17
00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.000
The case study is
a common way for

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.175
employers to assess job skills

19
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:51.065
and gain insight into how you

20
00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:54.365
approach common
data-related challenges.

21
00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.570
Different employers
might send you

22
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.630
different kinds of case studies.

23
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.830
For example, you might be

24
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.515
asked to clean and
analyze a data set,

25
00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:05.360
offer a proposal around how to

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.310
measure the success of a project,

27
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.500
or figure out and define metrics

28
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.905
of success for a
specific product.

29
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.300
Usually, there's a time limit

30
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.700
for the case study
you've been asked to do.

31
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.850
For example, a potential
employer might give

32
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.970
you some sample data
and project questions

33
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.285
and ask you to create
a presentation or memo

34
00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:30.110
with your recommendations
in 24 to 48 hours.

35
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.139
That time limit can be
a little challenging.

36
00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:34.700
But the good news is,

37
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.960
your answer to the case study
doesn't have to be perfect.

38
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.710
What's important is that you

39
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.390
show off your thought process

40
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.725
so that the interviewers can

41
00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.515
understand how you
approach the problem.

42
00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.140
You can use the data
analysis process

43
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.080
we've learned throughout
this program to guide you.

44
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.985
Let's check out an example

45
00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:55.175
and break down all of the parts.

46
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.500
This case study has all of

47
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.995
the information we'd need
to perform this task.

48
00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:04.460
It starts here, with the
title and the industry

49
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.424
focus: predicting

50
00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:09.965
employee attrition rate
for human resources.

51
00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:12.755
It also includes a
problem statement

52
00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:15.665
outlining what the
overall goal is.

53
00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:19.160
In this case, they're
asking for a deep dive into

54
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.650
key data analytics concepts to

55
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.175
predict the employee attrition
rate in the organization,

56
00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.170
and which factors influence

57
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.400
an employee to leave
the organization.

58
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.060
Basically, this case study
is interested in predicting

59
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.100
the rate at which employees might

60
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.830
leave the organization and why.

61
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.755
There's some more specific
goals in the next section.

62
00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:47.210
It's asking us to find
the probability of

63
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.900
an employee leaving the company
over the next five years.

64
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.230
That's pretty straightforward,
but they're also

65
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.410
interested in ways to
improve employee retention.

66
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.410
This next section is really key.

67
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.050
The deliverables are
what we'll actually

68
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.995
give them once we've
completed the case study.

69
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:08.840
In this example,
they're asking for

70
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.564
a presentation outlining

71
00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:13.100
our findings and recommendations.

72
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.040
Finally, they've
included some sections

73
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.695
about the data we'll
use for this task.

74
00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:22.705
Here, it's a dataset
that we can download.

75
00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:26.570
Now we know more about
case studies and how they

76
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.320
might be presented to us in
a job application process.

77
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.440
But people who are passionate
about data analytics

78
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.240
will sometimes do case studies on

79
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.069
their own time and add them
to a personal portfolio.

80
00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.450
A portfolio is a collection of

81
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.005
case studies that can be shared
with potential employers.

82
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:49.175
Portfolios can be stored on
public websites like GitHub,

83
00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:53.305
Kaggle, or Tableau,
or on your blog.

84
00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:56.975
Your portfolio can also
be linked in your resume.

85
00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:59.765
This will give you examples
of how you approached

86
00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:01.850
data tasks in the past

87
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.510
that you can talk about
in your interview.

88
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.430
These portfolios
showcase your skills and

89
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.280
help you stand out
in job applications.

90
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.215
On top of the case study,

91
00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:13.670
we'll talk about building

92
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.265
your portfolio and
how to share it.

93
00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.500
This will be a great
building block

94
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.845
that you can use to
build up your resume.

95
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:22.880
Coming up, we'll check out

96
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.980
some great examples
of case studies

97
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.630
and portfolios that will

98
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.000
hopefully inspire you
as you start your own.
